##  📖 Overview

This challenge is a great opportunity to test and refine your layout skills, especially if you're still getting comfortable with **responsive design**. The task involves building a profile card component that doesn't shift or change, which makes it a good fit for those who are newer to working with responsive websites. The goal is to replicate the design of the profile card as closely as possible.

For this project, I used **SCSS** to manage the styles, making it easier to maintain and customize the design. While the challenge itself doesn't require any specific tools, I chose SCSS to help streamline the styling process and improve the overall structure of the CSS.

###  🔬 What I learned

In this project, I mainly focused on working with `background-image` and adding responsive backgrounds. While I have made progress, I still have more to learn about this aspect of design. It's an area I’m eager to continue developing, and I plan to improve this part of the project in the near future as I refine my understanding of responsive background handling and performance optimization.
